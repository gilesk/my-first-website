# My Very First Webpage

## Welcome!

This is a project for the Code Institute course on User-Centric Front-End Development.  

Page Function
-------------
1. The pages show the different technologies covered in each of the 3 streams with their badges or shields.  

2. When these logos are clicked the user is taken to a Wikipedia page describing the technology.

Technical Issues
----------------
* Languages used
  - HTML for the basic structure and content
  - CSS for the page styling
* File Organisation:  
  - There is a separate .html file for each web page  
  - The page style is controlled by CSS code in a separate .css file
